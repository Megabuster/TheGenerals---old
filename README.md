Game of the Generals

This game will be designed using TypeScript primarily. 

The rules of the game are as follows:
Starting with a blank board, both players select where to place their 21 pieces. 
(Neither player can ever see which pieces the other player has on the field.)
Once the pieces are in place, take turns moving pieces. Pieces can only move 1 square vertically or horizontally.
The primary objective is to kill the enemy flag.
Any piece that tries to move onto a square occupied by an enemy piece will do battle.
Usually the stronger piece will hold control over the square while the other dies (the type of piece remains hidden).
If a flag attacks another flag, only the attacking flag survives and the game is won by the player that attacked.
If your flag reaches the enemy backline, like a pawn promotion in Chess, you can win. 
(However, your flag must survive on the backline for a turn before you claim victory.)
